Algorithm Name: Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)


Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:

Initialization:

Choose a starting node (often the depot or a randomly selected node) to begin the tour.
Mark this node as visited.

Main Loop:
While there are unvisited nodes:
For the current node, find the nearest unvisited neighbor.
Select the nearest neighbor as the next node to visit.
Move to this neighbor node and mark it as visited.
Update the current node to be the newly visited neighbor.
Repeat this process until all nodes (orders) have been visited.

Return to Starting Point:
Once all nodes have been visited, return to the starting node to complete the tour.
Add an edge from the last visited node back to the starting node.
This creates a closed tour, where every node is visited exactly once and the tour ends at the starting point.
Optimization (Optional):

After completing the initial tour, some variations of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm may perform optimization steps to improve the tour's quality.
Common optimization techniques include:
2-opt swaps: Swapping two edges in the tour to potentially reduce the total distance traveled.
Lin-Kernighan Heuristic: A more advanced local search method for improving tour quality.
Output:

The output of the algorithm is the sequence of nodes visited during the tour, starting and ending at the chosen starting point.
This sequence represents the order in which the salesman should visit the cities/customers to minimize the total distance traveled.



Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes (cities/customers) in the TSP instance.
The space complexity is O(n) due to the need to store visited nodes and the tour sequence.
