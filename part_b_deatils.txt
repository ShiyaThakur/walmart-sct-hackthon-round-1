Algorithm Overview:

The algorithm used in the provided code is the Greedy Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to determine the most efficient set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a given set of customers while minimizing total distance traveled or other relevant costs.


1. Greedy Algorithm:
The Greedy Algorithm is employed to solve the VRP in this implementation. It starts from a designated depot location and iteratively selects the nearest unvisited customer to the current location until all customers are visited. This process continues until all vehicles reach their capacity limit or no more customers are left to be served.

Algorithm Time Complexity:

Greedy Algorithm:
Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of customers (or orders).
The time complexity arises primarily from calculating the distance matrix, which is O(n^2), where n is the number of customers. Additionally, finding the nearest neighbor in each iteration also contributes to the overall time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(n^2) for storing the distance matrix.


2. Algorithm Variants for Different Datasets:

Dataset 1:
It appears to handle a smaller dataset with 20 orders.
Given the smaller size, the Greedy Algorithm directly assigns routes to vehicles, potentially resulting in more optimal solutions within reasonable computation times.

Dataset 2:
This dataset is larger, containing 30 orders.
Due to the larger size, the Greedy Algorithm may not guarantee optimal solutions, and its performance may degrade.

However, the code doesn't explicitly change the algorithm for different datasets. It seems to use the same Greedy Algorithm for both datasets.


3. Time and Space Complexity Summary:

Dataset 1:
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n^2)
Dataset 2:
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n^2)

This summary indicates that the time and space complexities remain consistent across datasets as the algorithm implementation remains the same. However, for larger datasets, the performance may vary due to potential suboptimal solutions generated by the Greedy Algorithm.
